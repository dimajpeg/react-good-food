# NFT Marketplace Landing Page

This project is a fully responsive landing page for an NFT marketplace, developed as a final project for a Front-End course. The primary goal was to build a modern, dynamic, and visually appealing user interface based on a Figma design.

The entire project is built using React and demonstrates a component-based architecture, dynamic data rendering, and a mobile-first approach to styling.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is broken down into small, reusable React components for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Content for sections like "Trending Collection" and "Top Creators" is rendered dynamically from a local `data.json` file, simulating a real API call.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout is adapted for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using CSS Modules and media queries.
- **Advanced Adaptive Logic:** A custom hook (`useWindowWidth`) is used to change the number of displayed items based on the screen width, improving performance on smaller devices.
- **Modern CSS:** Styled with CSS Modules to prevent class name conflicts and organized with a "Desktop-First" or "Mobile-First" approach.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface with a component-based structure.
- **React Hooks:** `useState` for managing component state and `useEffect` for handling side effects like data fetching.
- **Custom Hooks:** To encapsulate and reuse stateful logic (e.g., `useWindowWidth`).
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For application logic, including methods like `.map()` and `.slice()`.
- **CSS Modules:** For locally scoped and modular CSS.
- **HTML5**
